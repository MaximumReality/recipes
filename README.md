Mochkil’s Snack Attack secret recipes 
🗄️ THE VAULT: Mochkil’s Culinary Database
Welcome to the official repository for Maximum Reality culinary data. This isn't just a recipe list; it is the decoded output of the Mochkil Chatbot, a gourmet AI programmed for Michelin-star extravagance.
📡 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
• The Chef: Mochkil, a tuxedo kitten and wild card programmer.
• The Logic: Gourmet-first programming that balances 24K gold opulence with "keeping it real" studio staples.
• The Platform: Built and maintained entirely on an iPhone 14 Pro Max from within the concrete shell.
🔓 HOW TO UNLOCK SECRET DATA
While many recipes are public, the Executive Chef hides "Redacted Ingredients" and "Secret Levels" within his YouTube Transmissions.
1. Watch the Transmission: Every Snack Attack episode on YouTube contains visual or auditory clues.
2. Find the Key: Look for hexadecimal codes in the backgrounds or specific phrases in the "Sci-Fi Synth" audio.
3. Decrypt the Recipe: Use those keys here in the Vault to unlock restricted data files, such as secret character skins for the Abduction arcade game.
